# Repair Spars

The Shift Pod tent has three different lengths of spars (poles): roof spars, lower wall spars, and upper roof spars.

### Replacing a Damaged Spar

If you have access to a replacement spar: 

1.  **Remove the damaged spar:**

    -   Twist off the hubcap in an anti-clockwise direction.
    -   Remove the retention ring.
    -   Now, pull the damaged spar out gently.
  
2. **Insert the new spar:**

    -   Take the new spar and insert it into the pocket at the designated location.
    -   Slightly flex the spar to allow the ball of the ferrule to drop into the socket securely.

3.  **Reassemble the components:**

    -   Place the retention ring loosely back in position.
    -   Put the hubcap back on and twist it to the right to tighten it securely.
    -   Finally, pull the retention ring back into place.

    
Ensure all components are tightly secured before using the tent to ensure stability and safety.

### Repairing a Broken Ferrule

> Ferrule is the piece that connects the tent poles to the hub. 

1. Super-glue the broken ferrule back together.

2.  Using a glove to protect your hands, drill out the broken ferrule from the carbon fiber pole. 

3.  While drilling, you may notice white fiberglass powder coming out. Avoid breathing in this powder.

4.  Apply generous amounts of superglue (or other suitable glue) to a nail or screw and insert inside the drilled hole.

5.  Allow the glue to dry completely, then reassemble the pole and put it back into the hub.
