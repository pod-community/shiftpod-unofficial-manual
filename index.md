# Shiftpod Unofficial Manual

Unfortunately, as of July 2023, Shiftpods do not come with an official Manual. This site is a community 
effort to create a manual for Shiftpods, and it's accessories. 

While there are official videos on the [Shiftpod YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@shiftpod136/videos), they can't be
consumed while being off the grid. Meanwhile, this guide [can be downloaded as a PDF](https://pod-community.github.io/shiftpod-unofficial-manual/all.pdf), and read offline.

Feel free to submit content via [pull requests](https://github.com/pod-community/shiftpod-unofficial-manual/pulls), or [open an issue](https://github.com/pod-community/shiftpod-unofficial-manual/issues). 
Make sure the content is original, or you have permission to use it.
