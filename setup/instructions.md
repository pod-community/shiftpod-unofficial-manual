# Setup Instructions

⚠️ Important Notes before Setup:

> - Remove the Hub Support: The Hub support included in the package is for shipping purposes only and is not meant for setup. Remove it before starting the setup process.
> - Tighten the Hubs: Make sure to tighten all the hubs on your ShiftPod. The easiest way to do this is when your ShiftPod is lying down. Turn all the hubs clockwise until they are snug.

## Step 1: Lay down your floor panel.

Lay down your floor panel, ensuring the rubberized side faces up to provide access to the center pole sleeve.

## Step 2: Pop out the walls.

Grab the orange handle on one wall nearest a door and pop it up.
Stake that side with the included stake kit.
Go inside the ShiftPod and pop up the roof Hub.
Continue to pop out all the other walls.

Important Note: When pushing on the hubs, never grab the Hub itself. Use an open hand to avoid pinching your fingers.

## Step 3: Secure the tent with tie lines and carabiners.

Use the set of carabiners and tie lines included in your ShiftPod package.
Clip one side of the line to the black loop on the center of the ShiftPod wall (not to the orange handle).
Take the other end of the line, make a loop, and slide carabiner through, slip the loop over the top of the 
carabiner and slide it down tight. Make a simple half hitch to secure the tie line.

## Step 4: Stake the tent.

Staking the ShiftPod will prevent it from moving away while you're applying pressure on the hubs during setup.
It's also essential to stake your ShiftPod for windy and unpredictable situations.

Step 5: Secure the floor panel.

Align the marked tags on the ShiftPod body and floor panel to secure the floor.
