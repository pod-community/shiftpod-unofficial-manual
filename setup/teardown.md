# Tear down and packing instructions

 ##   Before Tear down:
-  Remove all stakes from the ground, except for one in windy conditions.
-  Unzip the flooring, but keep the floor panel in place while packing.
+- If using a Blast Shield, remove and fold it into its bag.

##    Folding the Shiftpod:
a. Walk around the Shiftpod, pushing in the center of each wall.
b. Step under the skirt of the Shiftpod and push down on a roof support spar to collapse the roof.
c. Fold the Shiftpod in half and then in half again before rolling it into a tight bundle.
d. Secure the roll tightly with the two included cinch straps.

## Packing the Shiftpod into the Bag:
+a. Place the rolled Shiftpod into its carrying bag with the spar end going into the narrower end of the bag first.
+b. Once the narrow end is fully in, fit the wider end into the bag.
+c. Use the three straps integrated into the bag to secure the Shiftpod.
+d. Add the folded floor panel, stakes, Blast Shield bag (if used), and any other small accessories into the carrying bag. Zip it up.

##    Handling Moisture:
 - Due to the multiple layers of insulation, the Shiftpod may be dry to the touch but could have some moisture in the inner layers.
 - To prevent mildew and degradation, allow the Shiftpod to dry out at home for an extended period after use.

There is also a [Mildew Prevention & Cleaning Kit](https://shiftpod.com/shiftpod/accessories/shiftpod-mildew-prevention-cleaning-kit) available for purchase on the Shiftpod website.

##    Post-Trip Care: IMPORTANT!
 - **Airing Out:** Always unpack and set up your Shiftpod at home after your trip to let it air out thoroughly. Even if it feels dry, moisture can be trapped within the insulation layers from rain, dew, or condensation.
+- **Preventing Damage:** Airing out is crucial to prevent mold and mildew. This is also a good time to inspect for any damage or need for cleaning.
+- **Storage Tip:** Consider using desiccant packets inside the stored Shiftpod bag to help absorb residual moisture, but this does not replace proper airing out.

## Practice
It's highly recommended to practice setting up and tearing down your Shiftpod at home before your first trip to familiarize yourself with the process.
