# Cooling (A/C)

The Shiftpod reflects some of the sun's heat but requires good ventilation, and a shade structure. The official newsletter
below recommends using the MIDEA U shape Air Conditioner, as it cools the air inside without drawing air from outside. 
It also suggests using Aluminet for shade, cautioning against shade structures in direct contact with the SHIFTPOD.

Costco is a popular source for the A/C, might be worth waiting for a discount:
