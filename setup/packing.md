# Packing instructions

 ##   Before Packing:
-  Remove all stakes from the ground, except for one in windy conditions.
-  Unzip the flooring, but keep the floor panel in place while packing.

##    Folding the Shiftpod:
a. Walk around the Shiftpod, pushing in the center of each wall.
b. Step under the skirt of the Shiftpod and push down on a roof support spar to collapse the roof.
c. Fold the Shiftpod in half and then in half again before rolling it together.
d. Cinch down the included straps to fit the Shiftpod more easily into its carrying bag.

##    Packing the Floor Separately:
It is recommended to pack the floor panel separately to facilitate easier packing of the Shiftpod.

##    Handling Moisture:
 - Due to the multiple layers of insulation, the Shiftpod may be dry to the touch but could have some moisture in the inner layers.
 - To prevent mildew and degradation, allow the Shiftpod to dry out at home for an extended period after use.

There is also a [Mildew Prevention & Cleaning Kit](https://shiftpod.com/shiftpod/accessories/shiftpod-mildew-prevention-cleaning-kit) available for purchase on the Shiftpod website.
